# 📊 Statistics & Machine Learning Analysis  

Welcome to this repository! This project contains various statistical and machine learning analyses performed on different datasets. The goal is to explore, visualize, and model data to extract insights and make predictions.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- **`Modules/`** – Majority of the analysis is using scikit-learn module  
- **`notebooks/`** – Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and ML models  
- **`scripts/`** – Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training  
- **`results/`** – Reports, visualizations, and model performance metrics  

## 📈 Topics Covered  

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Statistical Tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, etc.)  
✅ Regression & Classification Models  
✅ Feature Engineering & Selection  
✅ Time Series Analysis  
✅ Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction  
✅ Deep Learning (soon...)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Visual Studio Code**
